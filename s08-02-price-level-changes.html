    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_p01" revision="30227" revisionflag="fwkrev_changed">Concern about changes in the price level has always dominated economic discussion. With inflation in the United States generally averaging only between 2% and 3% each year since 1990, it may seem surprising how much attention the behavior of the price level still commands. Yet inflation was a concern in 2004 when there was fear that the rising price of oil could trigger higher prices in other areas. Just the year before, when inflation fell below 2%, there was talk about the risk of deflation. That did not happen; prices continued rising. Inflation rose substantially in the first half of 2008, renewing fears about subsequent further increases.  2010 brought on renewed concern of possible deflation. Just what are inflation and deflation? How are they measured? And most important, why do we care? These are some of the questions we will explore in this section.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Inflation</a><span class="glossdef">An increase in the average level of prices.</span></span> is an increase in the average level of prices, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">deflation</a><span class="glossdef">A decrease in the average level of prices.</span></span> is a decrease in the average level of prices. In an economy experiencing inflation, most prices are likely to be rising, whereas in an economy experiencing deflation, most prices are likely to be falling.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_p03">There are two key points in these definitions:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_l02">
        <li>Inflation and deflation refer to changes in the average level of prices, not to changes in particular prices. An increase in medical costs is not inflation. A decrease in gasoline prices is not deflation. Inflation means the average level of prices is rising, and deflation means the average level of prices is falling.</li>
        <li>Inflation and deflation refer to <em class="emphasis">rising</em> prices and <em class="emphasis">falling</em> prices, respectively; therefore, they do not have anything to do with the <em class="emphasis">level</em> of prices at any one time. “High” prices do not imply the presence of inflation, nor do “low” prices imply deflation. Inflation means a positive <em class="emphasis">rate of change</em> in average prices, and deflation means a negative <em class="emphasis">rate of change</em> in average prices.</li>

In the 1960s the inflation rate rose, and it became dramatically worse in the 1970s. The inflation rate plunged in the 1980s and continued to ease downward in the 1990s. It remained low in the early 2000s and began to accelerate in 2007 and has remained low since.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p03">Whether one regards inflation as a “good” thing or a “bad” thing depends very much on one’s economic situation. If you are a borrower, unexpected inflation is a good thing—it reduces the value of money that you must repay. If you are a lender, it is a bad thing because it reduces the value of future payments you will receive. Whatever any particular person’s situation may be, inflation always produces the following effects on the economy: it reduces the value of money and it reduces the value of future monetary obligations. It can also create uncertainty about the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p04">Suppose that you have just found a $10 bill you stashed away in 1990. Prices have increased by about 50% since then; your money will buy less than what it would have purchased when you put it away. Your money has thus lost value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p05">Money loses value when its purchasing power falls. Since inflation is a rise in the level of prices, the amount of goods and services a given amount of money can buy falls with inflation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p06">Just as inflation reduces the value of money, it reduces the value of future claims on money. Suppose you have borrowed $100 from a friend and have agreed to pay it back in one year. During the year, however, prices double. That means that when you pay the money back, it will buy only half as much as it could have bought when you borrowed it. That is good for you but tough on the person who lent you the money. Of course, if you and your friend had anticipated such rapid inflation, you might have agreed to pay back a larger sum to adjust for it. When people anticipate inflation, they can adjust for its consequences in determining future obligations. But <em class="emphasis">unanticipated</em> inflation helps borrowers and hurts lenders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p07">Inflation’s impact on future claims can be particularly hard on people who must live on a fixed income, that is, on an income that is predetermined through some contractual arrangement and does not change with economic conditions. An annuity, for example, typically provides a fixed stream of money payments. Retirement pensions sometimes generate fixed income. Inflation erodes the value of such payments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p08">Given the danger posed by inflation for people on fixed incomes, many retirement plans provide for indexed payments. An indexed payment is one whose dollar amount changes with the rate of change in the price level. If a payment changes at the same rate as the rate of change in the price level, the purchasing power of the payment remains constant. Social Security payments, for example, are indexed to maintain their purchasing power.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p09">Because inflation reduces the purchasing power of money, the threat of future inflation can make people reluctant to lend for long periods. From a lender’s point of view, the danger of a long-term commitment of funds is that future inflation will wipe out the value of the amount that will eventually be paid back. Lenders are reluctant to make such commitments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p10">Uncertainty can be particularly pronounced in countries where extremely high inflation is a threat. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hyperinflation</a><span class="glossdef">An inflation rate in excess of 200% per year.</span></span> is generally defined as an inflation rate in excess of 200% per year. Inflation of that magnitude erodes the value of money very quickly. Hyperinflations occurred in Germany in the 1920s and in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. There are stories about how people in Germany during the hyperinflation brought wheelbarrows full of money to stores to pay for ordinary items. In Yugoslavia in 1993 there was a report of a shop owner barring the entrance to his store with a mop while he changed his prices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p11">The inflation rate rose to an astronomical rate in 2008 in Zimbabwe. As the government printed more money and put it in circulation, prices rose. When inflation began to accelerate, the government found it “necessary” to print more and more money, causing prices to rise very fast. The inflation rate in Zimbabwe reached an astonishing 11.2 million percent in July of 2008, according to Zimbabwe’s Central Statistics Office. A loaf of bread cost 200,000 Zimbabwe dollars in February 2008. That same loaf cost 1.6 trillion Zimbabwe dollars by August.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenmacro-fn05_007">“Zimbabwe Inflation Hits 11,200,000%,” <a class="link" href="http://www.CNN.com">CNN.com</a>, August 19, 2008.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p12">Do the problems associated with inflation imply that deflation would be a good thing? The answer is simple: no. Like inflation, deflation changes the value of money and the value of future obligations. It also creates uncertainty about the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p13">If there is deflation, the real value of a given amount of money rises. In other words, if there had been deflation since 2000, a $10 bill you had stashed away in 2000 would buy more goods and services today. That sounds good, but should you buy $10 worth of goods and services now when you would be able to buy even more for your $10 in the future if the deflation continues? When Japan experienced deflation in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Japanese consumers seemed to be doing just that—waiting to see if prices would fall further. They were spending less per person and, as we will see throughout our study of macroeconomics, less consumption often meant less output, fewer jobs, and the prospect of a recurring recessions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p14">And, if you had to use the $10 to pay back a debt you owed, the purchasing power of your money would be higher than when you borrowed the money. The lender would feel good about being able to buy more with the $10 than you were able to, but you would feel like you had gotten a raw deal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p15">Unanticipated deflation hurts borrowers and helps lenders. If the parties anticipate the deflation, a loan agreement can be written to reflect expected changes in the price level.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p16">The threat of deflation can make people reluctant to borrow for long periods. Borrowers become reluctant to enter into long-term contracts because they fear that deflation will raise the value of the money they must pay back in the future. In such an environment, firms may be reluctant to borrow to build new factories, for example. This is because they fear that the prices at which they can sell their output will drop, making it difficult for them to repay their loans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s01_p17">Deflation was common in the United States in the latter third of the 19th century. In the 20th century, there was a period of deflation after World War I and again during the Great Depression in the 1930s.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Price Indexes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s02_p01">How do we actually measure inflation and deflation (that is, changes in the price level)? Price-level change is measured as the percentage rate of change in the level of prices. But how do we find a price level?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s02_p02">Economists measure the price level with a price index. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price index</a><span class="glossdef">A number whose movement reflects movement in the average level of prices.</span></span> is a number whose movement reflects movement in the average level of prices. If a price index rises 10%, it means the average level of prices has risen 10%.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s02_p03">There are four steps one must take in computing a price index:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Select the kinds and quantities of goods and services to be included in the index. A list of these goods and services, and the quantities of each, is the “market basket” for the index.</li>
            <li>Determine what it would cost to buy the goods and services in the market basket in some period that is the base period for the index. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">base period</a><span class="glossdef">A time period against which costs of the market basket in other periods will be compared in computing a price index.</span></span> is a time period against which costs of the market basket in other periods will be compared in computing a price index. Most often, the base period for an index is a single year. If, for example, a price index had a base period of 1990, costs of the basket in other periods would be compared to the cost of the basket in 1990. We will encounter one index, however, whose base period stretches over three years.</li>
            <li>Compute the cost of the market basket in the current period.</li>
            <li>Compute the price index. It equals the current cost divided by the base-period cost of the market basket.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s02_p05">Suppose that we want to compute a price index for movie fans, and a survey of movie watchers tells us that a typical fan rents 4 movies on DVD and sees 3 movies in theaters each month. At the theater, this viewer consumes a medium-sized soft drink and a medium-sized box of popcorn. Our market basket thus might include 4 DVD rentals, 3 movie admissions, 3 medium soft drinks, and 3 medium servings of popcorn.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s02_p06">Our next step in computing the movie price index is to determine the cost of the market basket. Suppose we surveyed movie theaters and DVD-rental stores in 2007 to determine the average prices of these items, finding the values given in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s02_t01">Table 5.1 "Pricing a Market Basket"</a>. At those prices, the total monthly cost of our movie market basket in 2007 was $48. Now suppose that in 2008 the prices of movie admissions and DVD rentals rise, soft-drink prices at movies fall, and popcorn prices remain unchanged. The combined effect of these changes pushes the 2008 cost of the basket to $50.88.</p>

When the media report the U.S. inflation rate, the number cited is usually a rate computed using the CPI. The CPI is also used to determine whether people’s incomes are keeping up with the costs of the things they buy. The CPI is often used to measure changes in the cost of living, though as we shall see, there are problems in using it for this purpose.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p02">The market basket for the CPI contains thousands of goods and services. The composition of the basket is determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), an agency of the Department of Labor, based on Census Bureau surveys of household buying behavior. Surveyors tally the prices of the goods and services in the basket each month in cities all over the United States to determine the current cost of the basket. The major categories of items in the CPI are food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p03">The current cost of the basket of consumer goods and services is then compared to the base-period cost of that same basket. The base period for the CPI is 1982–1984; the base-period cost of the basket is its average cost over this period. Each month’s CPI thus reflects the ratio of the current cost of the basket divided by its base-period cost.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_p01">Suppose your uncle started college in 1998 and had a job busing dishes that paid $5 per hour. In 2008 you had the same job; it paid $6 per hour. Which job paid more?</p>

But $1 had greater purchasing power in 1998 than in 2008 because prices were lower in 1998 than in 2008.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Are Price Indexes Accurate Measures of Price-Level Changes?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p01">Price indexes that employ fixed market baskets are likely to overstate inflation (and understate deflation) for four reasons:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_l01">
                <li>Because the components of the market basket are fixed, the index does not incorporate consumer responses to changing relative prices.</li>
                <li>A fixed basket excludes new goods and services.</li>
                <li>Quality changes may not be completely accounted for in computing price-level changes.</li>
                <li>The type of store in which consumers choose to shop can affect the prices they pay, and the price indexes do not reflect changes consumers have made in where they shop.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p02">To see how these factors can lead to inaccurate measures of price-level changes, suppose the price of chicken rises and the price of beef falls. The law of demand tells us that people will respond by consuming less chicken and more beef. But if we use a fixed market basket of goods and services in computing a price index, we will not be able to make these adjustments. The market basket holds constant the quantities of chicken and beef consumed. The importance in consumer budgets of the higher chicken price is thus overstated, while the importance of the lower beef price is understated. More generally, a fixed market basket will overstate the importance of items that rise in price and understate the importance of items that fall in price. This source of bias is referred to as the substitution bias.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p03">The new-product bias, a second source of bias in price indexes, occurs because it takes time for new products to be incorporated into the market basket that makes up the CPI. A good introduced to the market after the basket has been defined will not, of course, be included in it. But a new good, once successfully introduced, is likely to fall in price. When VCRs were first introduced, for example, they generally cost more than $1,000. Within a few years, an equivalent machine cost less than $200. But when VCRs were introduced, the CPI was based on a market basket that had been defined in the early 1970s. There was no VCR in the basket, so the impact of this falling price was not reflected in the index. The DVD player was introduced into the CPI within a year of its availability.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p04">A third price index bias, the quality-change bias, comes from improvements in the quality of goods and services. Suppose, for example, that Ford introduces a new car with better safety features and a smoother ride than its previous model. Suppose the old model cost $20,000 and the new model costs $24,000, a 20% increase in price. Should economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) simply record the new model as being 20% more expensive than the old one? Clearly, the new model is not the same product as the old model. BLS economists faced with such changes try to adjust for quality. To the extent that such adjustments understate quality change, they overstate any increase in the price level.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p05">The fourth source of bias is called the outlet bias. Households can reduce some of the impact of rising prices by shopping at superstores or outlet stores (such as T.J. Maxx, Wal-Mart, or factory outlet stores), though this often means they get less customer service than at traditional department stores or at smaller retail stores. However, since such shopping has increased in recent years, it must be that for their customers, the reduction in prices has been more valuable to them than loss of service. Prior to 1998, the CPI did not account for a change in the number of households shopping at these newer kinds of stores in a timely manner, but the BLS now does quarterly surveys and updates its sample of stores much more frequently. Another form of this bias arises because the government data collectors do not collect price data on weekends and holidays, when many stores run sales.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p06">Economists differ on the degree to which these biases result in inaccuracies in recording price-level changes. In late 1996, Michael Boskin, an economist at Stanford University, chaired a panel of economists appointed by the Senate Finance Committee to determine the magnitude of the problem in the United States. The panel reported that the CPI was overstating inflation in the United States by 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points per year. Their best estimate was 1.1 percentage points, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_t01">Table 5.2 "Estimates of Bias in the Consumer Price Index"</a>. Since then, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has made a number of changes to correct for these sources of bias and since August 2002 has reported a new consumer price index called the Chained Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (C-CPU-U) that attempts to provide a closer approximation to a “cost-of-living” index by utilizing expenditure data that reflect the substitutions that consumers make across item categories in response to changes in relative prices.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenmacro-fn05_009">Robert Cage, John Greenlees, and Patrick Jackman, “Introducing the Chained Consumer Price Index” (paper, Seventh Meeting of the International Working Group on Price Indices, Paris, France, May 2003), available at <a class="link" href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/superlink.htm">http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/superlink.htm</a>.</span> However, a 2006 study by Robert Gordon, a professor at Northwestern University and a member of the original 1996 Boskin Commission, estimates that the total bias is still about 0.8 percentage points per year, as also shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_t01">Table 5.2 "Estimates of Bias in the Consumer Price Index"</a>.</p>

                    <p class="para">The Boskin Commission reported that the CPI overstates the rate of inflation by 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points due to the biases shown, with a best-guess estimate of 1.1.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p07">These findings of upward bias have enormous practical significance. With annual inflation running below 2% in three out of the last 10 years and averaging 2.7% over the 10 years, it means that the United States has come close to achieving price stability for almost a decade.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p08">To the extent that the computation of price indexes overstates the rate of inflation, then the use of price indexes to correct nominal values results in an understatement of gains in real incomes. For example, average nominal hourly earnings of U.S. production workers were $13.01 in 1998 and $17.42 in 2007. Adjusting for CPI-measured inflation, the average real hourly earnings was $7.98 in 1998 and $8.40 in 2007, suggesting that real wages rose about 5.3% over the period. If inflation was overstated by 0.8% per year over that entire period, as suggested by Gordon’s updating of the Boskin Commission’s best estimate, then, adjusting for this overstatement, real wages should have been reported as $7.98 for 1998 and $9.01 for 2007, a gain of nearly 13%.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p09">Also, because the CPI is used as the basis for calculating U.S. government payments for programs such as Social Security and for adjusting tax brackets, this price index affects the government’s budget balance, the difference between government revenues and government expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that correcting the biases in the index would have increased revenue by $2 billion and reduced outlays by $4 billion in 1997. By 2007, the U.S. government’s budget would have had an additional $140 billion if the bias were removed.</p>

                    <li>Inflation is an increase in the average level of prices, and deflation is a decrease in the average level of prices. The rate of inflation or deflation is the percentage rate of change in a price index.</li>
                    <li>The consumer price index (CPI) is the most widely used price index in the United States.</li>
                    <li>Nominal values can be converted to real values by dividing by a price index.</li>
                    <li>Inflation and deflation affect the real value of money, of future obligations measured in money, and of fixed incomes. Unanticipated inflation and deflation create uncertainty about the future.</li>
                    <li>Economists generally agree that the CPI and other price indexes that employ fixed market baskets of goods and services do not accurately measure price-level changes. Biases include the substitution bias, the new-product bias, the quality-change bias, and the outlet bias.</li>

Compute real GDP in 2003 and 2004. Using the percentage change in the implicit price deflator as the gauge, what was the inflation rate over the period?</p>

By that measure, the Rays were something of a bargain. The table shows the cost of the fan price index market basket for 2008.</p>
